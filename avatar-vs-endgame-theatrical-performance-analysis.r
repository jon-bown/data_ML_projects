Records such as 'Highest-grossing movie', 'Fastest to \\$500 million', 'Highest initial release gross', and many, many [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_box_office_records_set_by_Avengers:_Endgame). As the weeks passed they were closing in on passing *Avatar*'s all time record for worldwide gross with many skeptical that it was even possible. Then there was the perhaps overrated re-release to try and get it over the last 26 million or so they needed to pass it up. But it all paid off on July 21st, when 15 weeks after initial release *Endgame* overcame what *Avatar* took 46 weeks to build up. This made me wonder why people weren't so sure if *Endgame* would beat *Avatar* when it clearly had the momentum from the day the first teaser trailer was released. \n","\n","I came across an article titled ['Avatar's Box Office Record Is Even More Impressive After Avengers: Endgame'](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474332/avatars-box-office-record-is-even-more-impressive-after-avengers-endgame) in which the author lays out an argument for why *Avatar*'s record is \"more impressive\" than *Endgame*'s. This is one of many articles that discuss the two movies as if one is diminished by the other referencing the presence or lack of one record. Some [articles](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/4-hurdles-avengers-endgame-faces-as-it-seeks-to-dethrone-avatar.html) were even skeptical of the possibility of a new record citing that *Endgame* hadn't broken the record before week 15. After looking at this match up from every possible angle I view these two movies very differently than in the context of just all-time global box office. What follows is a discussion of box office data to objectively understand the performance of both movies. *Avatar* and *Avengers: Endgame* are two very different movies for many reasons and to compare them based on one number is a bit naive. Marvel movie goer or not the box office numbers for *Avengers: Endgame* are quite impressive by any standard.

We also can't account for things like the NFL live showing on Sunday, Nov 2nd 2009. The trailer was shown for the first time to a live audience at the Cowboys vs. Seahawks game and on television. Another difference is that the first trailer was available only a month before release. Trailers today, and especially with Marvel movies, are shown several months in advance with the trailer for *Avengers: Endgame* coming out 5 months prior to release. Granted, the number of views of the *Avatar* was record breaking at the time for various platforms. YouTube was also a little over four years old at the time and the popularity was still in its infancy. In fact most of the top 20 trailers by views on YouTube were released after 2015. Despite all this, I think *Avatar* was successful at generating an audience early on because it was so different than the movies coming out at the time.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4d2bfc17","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013892,"end_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.871168","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.857276","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Budget and Innovation <a id=\"chapter5\"></a>\n","\n","\n","<table>\n","    <caption> Movie Budgets </caption>\n","<thead>\n","<tr class=\"header\">\n","<th style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"avenge\">Avengers: Endgame</th>\n","<th style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"avat\">AVATAR</th>\n","</tr>\n","</thead>\n","<tbody>\n","<tr class=\"odd\">\n","<td style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"tbltxt\">356 million</td>\n","<td style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"tbltxt\">237 million</td>\n","</tr>\n","\n","</tbody>\n","</table>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"487f02ea","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013679,"end_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.898308","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.884629","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["\n","Clearly *Endgame*'s budget was over 100 million more than *Avatar* and even accounting for inflation it comes just under 100 million. But *Avatar* was about more than just making a great IMAX film, James Cameron basically [pioneered](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/avatar-all-innovation-117052) the modern day motion capture which blends live action with CG animation. They developed a workflow that allowed Cameron to hold the camera at an actor and display their CG animation on a monitor in real time. Cameron was also able to [develop](https://www.slashfilm.com/five-innovations-in-james-camerons-avatar/) technologies called 'Simulcam', 'Facial Capture Head Rig', 'Facial Performance Replacement', and 'Fusion 3-D Camera System'. If I've learned anything thus far, its that we have *Avatar* and James Cameron to thank for all the motion capture utilized in the Marvel films. \n","\n","But regarding the actual record, *Avatar*'s movie record is based on an unadjusted gross revenue during both theatrical releases. Why does everyone talk about inflation when the record is held on an unadjusted number? If we adjust every theatrical release it actually drops to 15th place! Table 6 shows the ranking in this category. Original theatrical release as well as the number of re-releases seems to have the largest determination on the 'Worldwide Gross number' that gets the most attention.\n","\n","Movies in earlier years tended to run in the theater longer because theaters make more money the longer they play movies and there were a limited number of titles to show. Recently agreements between the studios and theaters allow the studios to take most of the profit share up front and then reduce this amount over time, increasing the profit share of the individual theaters. The idea is to incentivize theaters to hold onto the movie for longer. In recent years this has changed not only because new movies are released every week but because of box office blockbusters such as those from Marvel Studios. Even with low margins on ticket sales in the first few weeks, theaters benefit more from concession purchases during this time which has flipped the scales to create an incentive to jump on the newest movie rather than to keep even a box office goldmine like *Avengers: Endgame* on the docket for more than seven to ten weeks. \n","\n","Movie budget plays a large roll in determining marketing, cast, and ultimately box office appeal. Specifically with *Endgame* and *Avatar* we need more context because of the 10 year gap between releases. If we look at the most expensive movies of all time and check where *Avatar* fits into typical movie budgets in the year 2010 we see that it falls to 5th place.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"id":"3b3f8e3e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.929712Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.92795Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.979157Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.977272Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.070008,"end_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.982291","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.912283","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["colnames(budget_df) <- c(\"Rank\", \"Movie\", \"Year\", \"Cost\")\n","\n","df2 <- budget_df[which(budget_df$Year <= 2010),]\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","html_table <- kable(df2, row.names=FALSE, align=c('l','l', 'c', 'c'),col.names=c('Overall Rank 2019', \"Movie\", \"Year\", \"Cost (MM)\"), caption=table_nums('tab_3',caption=\"2010 Movie Budgets Ranked\"),\n","             longtable = FALSE, format=\"html\")  %>%\n","      kable_styling(latex_options = c(\"striped\", \"scale_down\", \"HOLD_position\"),\n","                    full_width = T, font_size = 16, position = \"left\")\n","\n","#lazy.matrix(html_table )"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4cbfefde","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013842,"end_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:47.00978","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:46.995938","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 16px;

In only two weeks *Avatar* became the number one movie of the 'Holiday' season. *Avatar* also generated a decent revenue per theater number despite only opening in about 1000 less theaters than Iron Man 2. But there is a hidden factor that no one really mentions with the numbers. According to box-office experts, *Avatar*'s marketing strategy emphasized the appeal of the cinematic experience in IMAX and 3D to sell more premium tickets and generate repeat viewings. Back then 3-D and IMAX showings could charge an average of three dollars more per ticket. Combine that with a 34 week first theatrical release and relatively low box office competition I'd say that's a great way to do well at the box office. \n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0fd7a237","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.013944,"end_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:47.496288","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T22:11:47.482344","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Weekly Performance <a id=\"chapter4\"></a>\n","\n","One major catalyst for *Avatar* was that it was in theaters for 34 weeks. 34 weeks people!

Of course most of these movies had multiple re-releases, but the number of weeks corresponds to original distribution or theatrical release.  \n","\n","It is hard to know what the source of the lengthy theatrical release is. Could it be that the movie is doing so well that the theaters keep it longer? Or could it be that the theaters agreement with the movie was longer than usual? It is hard to find data or information about that but we do know that *Avatar* had pretty smooth sailing through the box office with a lack of competition and higher prices for the IMAX and 3D tickets. It makes sense that theaters would hang on to a winner if it came through the doors. But if *Avatar* had low competition that is one more reason that *Endgame*'s performance is so impressive. *Endgame* was going up against a summer box office with huge franchise names which included competition from its own studio, Disney. *Avatar* went 11 weeks before it faced a big name, 'Alice in Wonderland' (if you consider that big) where *Endgame* only had a two weeks before the next big movie with perhaps a somewhat similar audience, Pokemon: Detective Pikachu. However, if you're like me and aren't as impressed with *Avatar*'s numbers as everyone else seems to be, this one data point might change your mind.

releases can make a huge difference in worldwide gross for obvious reasons. In this case, almost 3/4 of the worldwide gross number for *Avatar* came from releases in foreign countries. We can also see that *Avatar* had a much wider foreign release (76 countries) compared to *Avengers: Endgame* (56 countries). Of course smaller countries will tend to contribute smaller amounts to overall box office than large countries like Russia or China. The charts below examine this relationship by looking at the total population of a country vs. the total amount grossed. The idea with these charts is if a country falls toward the lower right portion than the movie was much less widely popular than the countries that fall into the top left area. If there is a high population, high popularity foreign release it will look like the China circle in the *Endgame* plot.

Here we can see the manifestation of the lack of competition at the theater throughout the first weeks of *Avatar*'s release. *Avatar* was kept in more theaters longer which could be a result of theaters trying to keep a steady audience given the limited successful options at the time. It could also have been a longer contract for theaters which means that they have to wait longer for an increased percentage of gross ticket sales. In any case, don't be fooled here by just the theater count. There could be a lot of other factors contributing to *Avatar*'s longer lasting theater presence. But still, even the re-release of *Endgame* couldn't beat out the number of theaters showing *Avatar* during week ten and on.

The interpretation of all these comparisons is mixed. *Endgame* had a much wider re-release than *Avatar* but *Avatar* brought in a larger audience per theater throughout the release. The percent change in weekend revenue is a little deceiving because *Avatar* went from bringing in 10 grand the last weekend to 4 million during re-release. *Endgame* went from one million to six million in the same regard. The number of tickets sold shows again that Endgame had a larger re-release audience but these were at different points relative to the theatrical release. Overall these were two very different re-releases given the timing of each one, but *Endgame* dominated the dollar amounts while *Avatar* was perhaps a higher quality re-release that delivered more value to individual theaters and brought in a consistent audience week over week.\n","\n","\n","\n","<table>\n","<thead>\n","<tr class=\"header\">\n","<th style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"avat\"></th>\n","<th style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"avenge\">Avengers: Endgame</th>\n","<th style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"avat\">Avatar</th>\n","</tr>\n","</thead>\n","<tbody>\n","<tr class=\"odd\">\n","<td style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"tbltxt\">Release Weekend</td>\n","<td style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"tbltxt\">Jun 28-30</td>\n","<td style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"tbltxt\">Aug 27-29</td>\n","</tr>\n","<tr class=\"even\">\n","<td style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"tbltxt\">Weekend Gross</td>\n","<td style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"tbltxt\">\\$6,108,700 (Inf.

Having said that, they had a 1040\\% increase in the number of theaters showing the movie that weekend and they made over a million more that weekend then *Avatar* made the first weekend of re-release.

It really was a huge accomplishment for its time and for the type of movie that was being presented. However, when you dig into the numbers *Avatar*'s success was a result of many factors other than perhaps being a great film. The argument that *Endgame* is a better movie than *Avatar* or vice-versa just based on the worldwide gross revenue number is really naive. *Avatar*'s largest differentiating factor was the technology used to film the movie and create a really unique immersive experience. But *Avatar* falls into a category of films that make a lot of money because they are in the theater for so much longer than normal and has relatively low competition. \n","\n","The main factors I found that contributed to a record-breaking box office number for *Avatar* were:\n","\n","- 34 week release time followed by 12 week re-release. \n","- Large distribution across the world (76 countries).\n","- Lack of competition at the box office.\n","- Higher ticket sales during economic recession. \n","- Higher average ticket prices (IMAX, 3D).\n","\n","\n","The main factors I found that makes *Avengers: Endgame* performance so impressive were:\n","\n","- Large competitive summer box office environment.\n","- Smaller foreign distribution than *Avatar*.\n","- Overall [declining](https://thehustle.co/why-is-movie-theater-popcorn-so-outrageously-expensive/) theater audience.\n","- Record set by 46 week release broken by week 15.\n","\n","Are *Avengers: Endgame* and *Avatar* on the same level becuase of the similarity in global box office?
