Is the *Avatar* record worth all the hype? <a id=\"chapter1\"></a>\n","\n","Ever since *Avengers: Endgame* came to theaters we have been hearing about all the box office records that were shattered. Records such as 'Highest-grossing movie', 'Fastest to \\$500 million', 'Highest initial release gross', and many, many [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_box_office_records_set_by_Avengers:_Endgame). As the weeks passed they were closing in on passing *Avatar*'s all time record for worldwide gross with many skeptical that it was even possible. Then there was the perhaps overrated re-release to try and get it over the last 26 million or so they needed to pass it up. But it all paid off on July 21st, when 15 weeks after initial release *Endgame* overcame what *Avatar* took 46 weeks to build up. This made me wonder why people weren't so sure if *Endgame* would beat *Avatar* when it clearly had the momentum from the day the first teaser trailer was released. \n","\n","I came across an article titled ['Avatar's Box Office Record Is Even More Impressive After Avengers: Endgame'](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474332/avatars-box-office-record-is-even-more-impressive-after-avengers-endgame) in which the author lays out an argument for why *Avatar*'s record is \"more impressive\" than *Endgame*'s. This is one of many articles that discuss the two movies as if one is diminished by the other referencing the presence or lack of one record. Some [articles](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/4-hurdles-avengers-endgame-faces-as-it-seeks-to-dethrone-avatar.html) were even skeptical of the possibility of a new record citing that *Endgame* hadn't broken the record before week 15. After looking at this match up from every possible angle I view these two movies very differently than in the context of just all-time global box office. What follows is a discussion of box office data to objectively understand the performance of both movies. *Avatar* and *Avengers: Endgame* are two very different movies for many reasons and to compare them based on one number is a bit naive. Marvel movie goer or not the box office numbers for *Avengers: Endgame* are quite impressive by any standard.

ten year gap between *Avengers: Endgame* and *Avatar* is somewhat apparent.

The comic book/superhero movie has been around long before *Avatar* and the audience could differ quite significantly. *Avatar* had fewer well-established actors in the cast especially compared to the Avengers team-up ensemble.

We also can't account for things like the NFL live showing on Sunday, Nov 2nd 2009. The trailer was shown for the first time to a live audience at the Cowboys vs. Seahawks game and on television. Another difference is that the first trailer was available only a month before release. Trailers today, and especially with Marvel movies, are shown several months in advance with the trailer for *Avengers: Endgame* coming out 5 months prior to release. Granted, the number of views of the *Avatar* was record breaking at the time for various platforms. YouTube was also a little over four years old at the time and the popularity was still in its infancy. In fact most of the top 20 trailers by views on YouTube were released after 2015. Despite all this, I think *Avatar* was successful at generating an audience early on because it was so different than the movies coming out at the time.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c3c7d0b1","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006675,"end_time":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.785447","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.778772","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Budget and Innovation <a id=\"chapter5\"></a>\n","\n","\n","<table>\n","    <caption> Movie Budgets </caption>\n","<thead>\n","<tr class=\"header\">\n","<th style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"avenge\">Avengers: Endgame</th>\n","<th style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"avat\">AVATAR</th>\n","</tr>\n","</thead>\n","<tbody>\n","<tr class=\"odd\">\n","<td style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"tbltxt\">356 million</td>\n","<td style=\"text-align: center;\", class=\"tbltxt\">237 million</td>\n","</tr>\n","\n","</tbody>\n","</table>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ece31339","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006638,"end_time":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.798571","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.791933","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["\n","Clearly *Endgame*'s budget was over 100 million more than *Avatar* and even accounting for inflation it comes just under 100 million. But *Avatar* was about more than just making a great IMAX film, James Cameron basically [pioneered](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/avatar-all-innovation-117052) the modern day motion capture which blends live action with CG animation. They developed a workflow that allowed Cameron to hold the camera at an actor and display their CG animation on a monitor in real time. Cameron was also able to [develop](https://www.slashfilm.com/five-innovations-in-james-camerons-avatar/) technologies called 'Simulcam', 'Facial Capture Head Rig', 'Facial Performance Replacement', and 'Fusion 3-D Camera System'. If I've learned anything thus far, its that we have *Avatar* and James Cameron to thank for all the motion capture utilized in the Marvel films. \n","\n","But regarding the actual record, *Avatar*'s movie record is based on an unadjusted gross revenue during both theatrical releases. Why does everyone talk about inflation when the record is held on an unadjusted number? If we adjust every theatrical release it actually drops to 15th place! Table 6 shows the ranking in this category. Original theatrical release as well as the number of re-releases seems to have the largest determination on the 'Worldwide Gross number' that gets the most attention.\n","\n","Movies in earlier years tended to run in the theater longer because theaters make more money the longer they play movies and there were a limited number of titles to show. Recently agreements between the studios and theaters allow the studios to take most of the profit share up front and then reduce this amount over time, increasing the profit share of the individual theaters. The idea is to incentivize theaters to hold onto the movie for longer. In recent years this has changed not only because new movies are released every week but because of box office blockbusters such as those from Marvel Studios. Even with low margins on ticket sales in the first few weeks, theaters benefit more from concession purchases during this time which has flipped the scales to create an incentive to jump on the newest movie rather than to keep even a box office goldmine like *Avengers: Endgame* on the docket for more than seven to ten weeks. \n","\n","Movie budget plays a large roll in determining marketing, cast, and ultimately box office appeal. Specifically with *Endgame* and *Avatar* we need more context because of the 10 year gap between releases. If we look at the most expensive movies of all time and check where *Avatar* fits into typical movie budgets in the year 2010 we see that it falls to 5th place.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"id":"82a5c722","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.814528Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.8133Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.851438Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.850117Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.049364,"end_time":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.854596","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.805232","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["colnames(budget_df) <- c(\"Rank\", \"Movie\", \"Year\", \"Cost\")\n","\n","df2 <- budget_df[which(budget_df$Year <= 2010),]\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","html_table <- kable(df2, row.names=FALSE, align=c('l','l', 'c', 'c'),col.names=c('Overall Rank 2019', \"Movie\", \"Year\", \"Cost (MM)\"), caption=table_nums('tab_3',caption=\"2010 Movie Budgets Ranked\"),\n","             longtable = FALSE, format=\"html\")  %>%\n","      kable_styling(latex_options = c(\"striped\", \"scale_down\", \"HOLD_position\"),\n","                    full_width = T, font_size = 16, position = \"left\")\n","\n","#lazy.matrix(html_table )"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"36f81560","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006981,"end_time":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.868612","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-25T21:59:54.861631","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["<table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 16px;
